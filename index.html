        <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
          physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s
          appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and
          equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>
        <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
          particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
          discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with.
          A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could
          have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
          repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
          of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
        <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
          heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged,
          warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the
          wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but
          would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>
        <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of
          the page and drew a double box around it.
          On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers
          reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and
          that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>
        <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic
            time</a> with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led
          by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center
          for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called
          <a href="">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe
          being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly
          a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old.
          They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof,
          Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
        </p>
        <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years,
          though many, including Dr. Guth,
          wondered whether it could ever be proved.</p>
        <p>
          If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the
          recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself.
          It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending
          14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies,
          is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover,
          beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes
          bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
        </p>
        <p><strong>‘As Big as It Gets’</strong></p>
        <p>
          In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at
          energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
          Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves,
          which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an
          early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a
          telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave
          radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was
          380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.

        <p>
          Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep,
          for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results
          in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of
          papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

      <h4>The Theory of Inflation</h4>
      <p>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the
        universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.</p>
    </section>

      <div class="blockText one">
        <p><span>THE UNIVERSE</span> is just under 14
          billion years old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we
          can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across.
          But there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even
          temperature.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockText two">
        <p><span>NOT ENOUGH TIME</span> The universe is not old enough
          for light to have traveled the vast distance from one side of the
          universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered
          patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockText three">
        <p><span> DISTANT COFFEE</span> At a smaller scale, imagine using a
          telescope to look a mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of
          steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockText four">
        <p><span> COFFEE EVERYWHERE</span> Now turn around and look a mile
          in the other direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature.
          Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction, you might want to
          look for another explanation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockText five">
        <p><span>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</span> There has not been enough time
          to carry coffee cups from place to place before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were
          somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain their even
          temperature.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockText six">
        <p><span>INFLATION</span> solves this problem. The theory proposes that,
          less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the
          speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the
          large-scale structures of the universe.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockText seven">
        <p><span>FLUCTUATION</span> Astronomers have now detected evidence of these
          ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation,
          which is energy left over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockText eight">
        <p><span>EXPANSION</span> Returning to our coffee, imagine a single,
          central pot expanding faster than light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands.
          That is something like inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and
          foam of the original pot.</p>

      <p>Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.</p>
      <p>Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such
        a definite confirmation in his lifetime.</p>
      <p>“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”</p>
      <p>The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis.
        Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few,
        meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
        (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.</p>

      <p>“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr.
        Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.</p>
      <p>Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular
        variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on
        vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague
        and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlfIVEy_YOA">knocked on his door with a bottle of
          Champagne</a> to tell him the news.</p>

        <figcaption><span class="figCaption">Stanford Professor Andrei Linde celebrates physics breakthrough</span> <span class="author">Video by StanfordUniversity</span></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered
        anything.
      </p>
      <p>“And then I told him that in the beginning we
        thought that this was a delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything,
        but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde
        wrote in an email.
      </p>
      <p>Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still
        hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a
        vacation,” he said.</p>
      <p>By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation
        had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture
        of jubilation and caution.</p>
      <p>Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that
        if this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries
        in the history of science.”</p>
      <p>John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head
        of a competing project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself
        deeply impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,”
        he said.</p>
      <p>Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that
        posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis, said that
        if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he expressed
        reservations about inflation.</p>
      <p>Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need
        for confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates
        based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European Space
        Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.</p>
      <p>“So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,”
        Dr. Krauss said.</p>
      <p>Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will
        report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams are
        trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.</p>
      <p> <strong>Spirals in the Sky</strong></p>
      <p>Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the
        cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias
        and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.</p>
      <p>Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves.
        He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of
        increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole,
        where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions.
        The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota,
        Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and
        Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
      </p>
      <p>“The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the
        ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering
        over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.</p>

      <p>In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave
        radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight
        preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.</p>
      <p>This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational
        waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction
        and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the direction
        of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result,
        maps of the polarization in the sky should have little arrows going
        in spirals.</p>
      <p>Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small
        differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s
        telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting
        thermometer.</p>
      <p>“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.</p>
      <p>The strength of the signal surprised the researchers,
        and they spent a year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer,
        making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors
        might beat them to the breakthrough.</p>
      <p><strong>A Special Time</strong></p>
      <p>The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists
        like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years
        ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of
        the universe.</p>
      <p>Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today:
        gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces.
        But they have long suspected that those are simply different
        manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe
        in its earliest, hottest moments.</p>
      <p>As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a
        fall from grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or
        brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics
        evolved, with one force after another splitting away.
      </p>
      <p>That was where Dr. Guth came in.
      </p>
      <p>Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay
        liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it
        is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze,
        releasing latent heat.
      </p>
      <p>Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a
        unified state too long. In that case, space itself would
        become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.
      </p>
      <p>Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would
        act as a kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up.
        Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force,
        the more space was created, the harder it pushed apart.
      </p>
      <p>What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size
        at least a trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck
        of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than
        a cosmic eye-blink.
      </p>
      <p>Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary
        particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead,
        resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars
        billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no
        such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe
        might be the ultimate free lunch.”
      </p>
      <p>Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from
        Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation, once started,
        is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable
        homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up,
        spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as
        the multiverse.
      </p>
      <p>So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund,
        but do not bother asking about going any deeper into the past.</p>
      <p>We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very
        beginning, because inflation erases everything that came before it.
        All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away,
        forever out of our view.</p>
      <p>“If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian
        astronomer who was not part of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”</p>
