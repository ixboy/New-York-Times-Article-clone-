                <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
                    physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s
                    appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and
                    equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>
                <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
                   particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
                   discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with.
                   A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could
                   have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
                   repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
                   of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
                <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
                   heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged,
                   warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the
                   wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but
                   would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>
                <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of
                    the page and drew a double box around it.
                    On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers
                    reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and
                    that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>
                <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic
                   time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led
                   by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center
                   for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>
